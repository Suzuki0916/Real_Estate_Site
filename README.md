# Real Estate Site 
### Made By [***DannyGlade***](https://github.com/DannyGlade)
This is a Real E-state Site Project Made with Laravel, Bootstarp, JQuery, DataTables, FancyApp.
I only made it for my College Project, but if you are here that means I might have posted it online somewhere and you are here to steal it or see as refrence, but it's okay.

## What can you do in this website
- Admin can handle facilities, cities, categories, properties, Reviews, Users, Change Password & Site settings
- User can surf properties, handle their profile, Change Password & Save and review properties if logged in
- Yeah that's not much I know but I'm still making and It's a College Project so nothing Serious is gonna happen.
> Please Note!
> Beacause I am not good of a designer I have only used bootstrap, and nothing else, yet. So if you are looking for fancy site this might not be it. otherwise it looks decent enogh and funtionalities are also working... (obviously there will be some bugs)

## Update Admin
Go to the Link that `php artisan serve` command gives you and Hopefully it should be working, I hope you are capable of any troubleshooting if any error occurs.

Admin site: `your_site_link/admin/dashboard`

- Admin Email
```bash
admin@admin.com
```
- Admin Password
```bash
admin123
```
Update CMS and Site Settings inside Admin Panel (/admin/dashboard) Once (empty or filled doesn't matter), and then goto frontend
> when project loads for first time db won't have values of CMS and Site setting, by updating those fields will be created, so frontend wouldn't show errors after that...

I am writing this documentaion while this project is still in making, because I was bored...

If You are still reading, then Thanks and Welcome...

Hope My project helps you any ways...
